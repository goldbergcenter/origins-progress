Checking an article

The following steps are needed to verify that an article has been added properly.

Core article functionality:

    Open the article and go to the last page.

    Check for endnotes, links, and updates.

    Test the links on the endnotes (the numbered endnote should link to the endnote in the text, that endnote should link back to the list on the last page.) (see below for code fixes)

    Test the links if there is a links section. (see below for code fixes)

    Test the link from the first page to the update section if one exists. (see below for code fixes)

    Check for broken links and images within the text of the article

    Open the images and maps and charts sections (if they exist)

        Make sure images load properly

        Make sure the title is not duplicated in the caption (the caption usually contains the source)

        Make sure that appropriate images exists under their corresponding sections (map with maps, photographs with images)

Code Fixes in Article Body:

[WARNING]
[WARNING: Make sure revisions are on before making any changes]
[WARNING: Edit all code in an external text editor]
[WARNING]

    Confirm that page breaks match the original article (be sure you do this before working on endnotes or update links, they are dependent upon page number)

    Confirm that endnotes are named and linked properly in code (see style guidelines)

    Confirm that proper hr and h3 tags accompany the endnotes and links (see style guidelines)

    Confirm that the updates are wrapped in the proper div and contain a h3 tag (see style guidelines)

    Click on the HTML icon for each text area. Confirm that no unnecessary inline styles or poor formatting exists in these fields.

Other fields:

    Confirm that all fields appear correct.

    Confirm that the Cover Image contains alternate text (this can be the caption, just make sure it describes the image).

    Upload MP3s and M4A/MP4s as needed.

    Add length of podcast as needed.

    Remove "N/A" from bibliography if it is all that exists in the field. (an empty bibliography field makes the link disappear)

Article author:

    Check on the article author and co-author profile

    If content (bio and picture) does not exist copy it from the original eHistory site

Tooltip functionality:

    The old site had a popup tooltip on some articles. This functionality has been replicated on the new site.

    You will need to add the class "hovertitle" and a link to any text that you would like to behave this way.

    Place the text you would like to appear in the tooltip inside of the title tag.

    If possible point the link to endnotes that contain the same information (graceful javascript degredation).

Style Guidelines:

HTML Style Rules for Origins

All inline endnotes should be surrounded by a link (with an id, title, and href attribute), a sup tag, and contain only a number. The endnote should be flush against the preceding character or punctuation with no spaces. The id should be formatted as follows: "_endref1". The word footnote should never be used as footnotes will always appear at the end of the document and never at the end of a page or section.

    Example:

    The end of my sentence.<a id="_endref1" title="click to see the endnote" href="/article/politics-international-adoption/page/0/3#_end1"><sup>1</sup></a> Next sentence.

All listings of footnotes should be a paragraph separated list with a linked number. The link should contain an id, title, and href. The id should be formatted as follows: "_end1"

    Example:

    <p><a id="_end1" title="View the related text." href="/article/the-url-for-this-article/page/0/0#_endref1">1</a> Example One.</p>
    <p><a id="_end2" title="View the related text." href="/article/the-url-for-this-article/page/0/0#_endref2">2</a> Example Two.</p>

Supplemental sections such as links and endnotes should be formatted with an opening <hr /> tag followed by a title wrapped in <h3> tags.

    Example:

    <hr />
    <h3>Endnotes</h3>

Updates should be wrapped in a div tag with the id of "update". A date of the update should be included in parenthesis with the title. An <hr /> tag is not required before an update.

    Example:

    <div id="update">
    <h3>UPDATE (November 7 2008)</h3>
    My update
    </div>

    Update announcements should be added to the Editor's Note with a date and link to the last page, where the update should be contained.

    Example:

    <p>UPDATE: This article was updated on November 7 2008 (<a title="Read the update." href="/article/second-amendment-goes-court/page/0/8#update">click here to read the update</a>)</p>

Pages are created in the main article by inserting the <!--pagebreak--> placeholder where ever you would like to start a new page. This can also be done through the WYSIWYG editor by clicking the last icon labeled "Insert a page break".

Cover Images, Article Maps and Charts, and Article Images must always have their "Alternate Text" field completed. For the Cover Image this can be the same as the caption so long as it describes the image. This field will not appear until after you upload the image.
